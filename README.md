# 👋 Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub

I'm a young developer and game creator passionate about storytelling, AI, and building cool things that leave an emotional impact. Whether it's a heartfelt visual novel, a chaotic co-op game, or a personal AI assistant, I'm always experimenting and learning.

## 🛠️ What I Build

### 🎮 Game Projects
- **School Life** (WIP)  
  A slice-of-life simulation game where players navigate high school dynamics, build relationships, and uncover hidden layers of each character. Includes mechanics like popularity, trust, announcements, time systems, and more.

- **Every Once in a While**  
  A short emotional visual novel made in Godot. The story follows a girl with only 7 days to live. It's designed to leave players with a sense of bittersweet incompleteness.  
  Final line: *"You don't have to remember or keep thinking about me every day, but make sure to do it every once in a while."*

- **Cleaning Chaos**  
  A quick co-op game where two players control robots and clean a messy house together using different keyboard key clusters.

- **OBI** (Dream Project – Early Concept)  
  A chaotic open-world game that fuses sci-fi, magic, and comedy. Follows four eccentric main characters handling global cases while behaving like teens in adult bodies. Massive ambition, currently in early ideation.
